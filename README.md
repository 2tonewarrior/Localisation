### Features

- allows an easier management of languages, keys and translations in the context of a multi language application
- uses the newer Laravel `__()` translation method and stores keys and translations inside a json file
- permits adding as many languages as you require and the easy creation of translations for the keys you need
- a language selector VueJS component is included, that can be used to set the current language for the active user

### Under the Hood

- the `languages` table stores the available languages for localisation 
   - `name` - the language code, e.g. 'en'
   - `display_name` - the lable for the language, visible in the UI, e.g. 'English'
   - `flag` - the icon class used for showing the flag

- when translating, the new Laravel mechanism is used, respectively the function `__()` 
- the main language is considered to be english
- the keys are, by convention, in english and in a human readable format e.g. 'Date of Birth', and if a key is not found, the value of the key is used instead
- the keys and the values for the keys are kept in `resources/lang/*code*.json`  where code is the language code, e.g. 'de' for german, with the exception for the english language, since keys are already in english
- due to Laravel's implementation, there are 4 translation categories which cannot be implemented using the new mechanism: `auth`, `pagination`, `passwords`, `validation`. For this reason, we keep the respective language files in their proper language sub-folders
- the moment a new language is added from the interface
    - the new language is saved in the database    
    - the four php translation files are copied to a newly created language folder    
    - a new JSON language file is generated, containing the keys for the existing translations. The keys are collected using as reference the first existing JSON file
- when deleting a language
    - the language is removed from the database    
    - the language folder and its contents are removed    
    - the JSON language file is removed

### Publishes

- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=localisation-component` - the VueJS component 
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-update` - a common alias for when wanting to update the VueJS component, 
once a newer version is released

### TO DO
